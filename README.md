# Project 1: AVL Tree and Graph Application

This C# project implements an AVL tree for storing and managing graph edges and provides functionalities for adding edges, finding the shortest path, processing requests, and printing graph information.

## Features

- **AVL Tree Implementation:** Balanced tree structure for efficient data management.
- **Graph Data Structure:** Stores edges and nodes with bidirectional connections.
- **Shortest Path Calculation:** Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes.
- **Data Loading:** Supports loading graph data from files in both old and new formats.
- **Request Processing:** Processes user requests for shortest path calculations.
- **Graph Information Printing:** Outputs graph details to a file.

# Project 2: Graph Visualization using QuickGraph and ZedGraph

This C# project uses QuickGraph for graph data management and ZedGraph for visualization. It includes functionalities to read a graph from a file, draw the graph, and display it using a Windows Forms application.

## Features

- **QuickGraph Integration:** Utilizes QuickGraph library for graph data structures.
- **Graph Visualization:** Uses ZedGraph for graphical representation of nodes and edges.
- **Randomized Node Placement:** Positions nodes randomly for visualization purposes.
- **Edge Weight Display:** Shows weights of edges in the graph.
